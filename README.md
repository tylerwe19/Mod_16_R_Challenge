## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Here are the results of the multi-linear regression that predicts mpg.


 1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
 * The vehicle length and ground clearance (along with the Intercept) have a significant impact on mpg. These variables/coefficients provided a non random amount of variance. This is indicated by the *** next to their p-value which means it's smaller than 0.001 and much smaller than 0.05, which means these variables are statistically significant. 
 2.
